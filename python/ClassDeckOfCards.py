Create a class that represents a deck of playing cards. The data for this object will be the cards themselves. The methods this class will have are the following

deal - a method that returns the value of the card on top of the deck. Once a card is dealt it cannot be dealt again until the deck is shuffled.

shuffle - a method that returns to the deck all dealt cards (for a total of 52, no Jokers) and places it in a random order.

fan - fan is a method that will simply list the cards in the deck from the top card to the card on the bottom of the deck.

isOrdered - a method that returns True if the deck is in order and False if it is not. If an ordered deck has a few cards dealt off of the top it is still in order. You do not need a full deck to be in order.

Order - a method that sorts the deck or puts the cards in order with the 2 of clubs beings lowest and the ace of spades being highest (while there 
is no real ranking of suits we’ll go with the standard poker/bridge ranking of clubs(lowest), diamonds, hearts, spades(highest). We will also count the Ace as a high card and not a low card. 
The Ace of a particular suit should be the highest card when a suit is sorted (2 thru A). To make it simple, a sorted deck is the following
2C, 3C, 4C, 5C, 6C, 7C, 8C, 9C, 10C, JC, QC, KC, AC, 2D, 3D, 4D, 5D, 6D, 7D, 8D, 9D, 10D, JD, QD, KD, AD, 2H, 3H, 4H, 5H, 6H, 7H, 8H, 9H, 10H, JH, QH, KH, AH, 2S, 3S, 4S, 5S, 6S, 7S, 8S, 9S, 10S, JS, QS, KS, AS
